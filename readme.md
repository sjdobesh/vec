# **vec**
a probably very bad vector library written in c. 
supports 2-4 dimensional vectors, arbitrarily sized and 4x4 
homogenous matrices, and basic functions for graphics programming.

## quick start

### compile
```
git clone https://github.com/sjdobesh/vec
cd vec
./install
```

### include
```c
#include <vec.h>
```
don't forget to link! math library required.
```
gcc prog.c -lvec -lm
```
